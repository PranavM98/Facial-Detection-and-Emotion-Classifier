# Physical Layer Data Augmentation Techniques for Face Recognition and Face Emotion Classification Data

## Abstract
In this project, we explore various physical layer augmentation techniques such as top-half mask, bottom-half mask, one-fourth mask, along with an image data augmentation technique, sharpness kernel, on the Face Recognition and Emotion Classification dataset using a VGG-16 model architecture. We learn that physical layer augmentation and data augmentation, in general, boosts model performance and reduces overfitting compared to the baseline. Specifically, masking one-fourth of the pixels in the physical layer, results in an accuracy of 69.76% similar to that of the baseline (no-mask) model of 72.31%. This shows us that 1/4th of the pixels can be discarded in a Face Emotion Classification experiment while still maintaining near baseline accuracy.
